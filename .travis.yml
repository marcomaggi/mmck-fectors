# Travis CI configuration for MMCK Fectors.

#page
#### about branch selection
#
# Travis-CI processes the file ".travis.yml" from the branch containing the git commit that triggers
# the build.  The file ".travis.yml" needs to be  present on all active branches of the project.  It
# is possible to select  which branches to process using a safelist (with  the keyword "only") and a
# blocklist (with the keyword "except"):
#
#    branches:
#      only:
#      - master
#      - stable
#      except:
#      - legacy
#      - /^experimental-.*$/
#
# it is possible  to use regular expressions to  select branch names, by putting  the regexp between
# slash characters.
#

#page
#### about compiler packages
#
# We select build-by-build  the packages to install;  it should speed up preparation.   By putting a
# single "addons" key at the top level: we would cause all the compilers to be installed for all the
# builds in the matrix; we do not want this.

#page
#### about compiler selection
#
# We select the compiler we want with the  "compiler" key.  This should set the environment variable
# CC to  the associated  compiler executable;  I have  verified that  it actually  does so  when the
# language is C.  I am not sure that it actually does it when the language is C++.
#
# To check which C or C++ compiler is actually selected, we can put the following in every "script:"
# key, before running the "configure" script as follows:
#
#    script: |
#      echo CC=$CC; $CC --version;
#      echo CXX=$CXX; $CXX --version;
#      ./configure
#

#page
#### about dependency packages
#
# We install dependency packages under "/usr/local", so appropriate directories must be added to the
# global path  environment variables, otherwise  the installed packages will  not be found  and used
# correctly by the "configure" script.
#
# Notice  that (as  of May  17, 2018)  Travis CI's  run-time system  raises a  warning if  the first
# directory in the PATH  environment variable is not the one that it  sets.  This causes problems if
# we install the dependencies under the directory "/tmp".
#
# We need the following in the global environment:
#
#   env:
#     global:
#       - PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig:/usr/local/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH;
#       - ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/local/share/aclocal:$ACLOCAL_PATH;
#
# Alternatively, we  can put the  following in every "script:"  key, before running  the "configure"
# script as follows:
#
#   script: |
#     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig:/usr/local/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH;
#     export ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/local/share/aclocal:$ACLOCAL_PATH;
#     ./configure
#
# To install dependency packages on Ubuntu we can do this:
#
#    addons:
#      apt:
#        sources:
#        - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
#        packages:
#        - texinfo
#        - gcc-8
#
# where the "sources:" block  tells Travis CI that some of the packages  under "packages:" are found
# in the package repository "ubuntu-toolchain-r-test".
#
# To install dependency packages on OS X we can do this:
#
#    addons:
#      homebrew:
#        packages:
#        - texinfo
#
